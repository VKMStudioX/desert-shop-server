### Desert Shop - MERN STACK - THIS IS THE 'ERN' part - Express.js, MongoDB and Node.js
This is the project based on/inspired by some of Udemy react, scss and mern courses, for getting the base knowledge of new technological databases (mongodb, mongoose) and back-end (node.js, express, etc), techniques, requests (which i want to have the knowledge), with the totally rebuilded front-end (which i want to specialize) and added some creativity functionallity to this.  
I wanted to do something more functional than little applications like milions variants of calculators or to-do-app. So I decided to go a bigger project.  

### Functionallity
You can register a new user with firebase api, or simply use the default user (zingipista).   
You can see, filter and buy the albums which you want (there is total 27 albums of the year 2020, in all shop and in grid at the top of the landing page).  
Any new user have a $1000 for start(register).
If you buy an album/s for some $$, you should be see the Spotify frame player for this album (at product page).
You also can rate the albums with 1-5 start system.
In future, there will be feature which users can recommend the albums and obtain a some credits from this.
